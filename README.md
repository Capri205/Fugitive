# Fugitive

Attempting to remake a demo that was projected onto the wall behind the bar I used to frequent in Tokyo back around 2004/5.
It was a top down view of a person rendered something like a stick man, running across a landscape made up green grass and
grey roads with white markings and the occasional car park. There was the odd car driving along the roads. Occasionally the
character would jump in a car and drive along the roads. These roads seem to be procedurally rendered. At some point the
character would abandon the car and again start to run across the landscape. There would also be the occasional police car
chasing the character, whether they were on foot or in a car. So, while we drank our beers and chatted this was, to me at
least, quite mesmerizing. I've always thought of recreating this, but it wasn't until I came across the great series by
Radu Mariescu [Radu Mariescu-Istodor](https://github.com/gniziemazity) on self driving cars. I believe this could be the
platform on which to achieve this recreation. Since I can find no reference to the original demo, I am calling this one Fugitive!
